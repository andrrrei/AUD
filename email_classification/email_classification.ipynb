    "Почему был выбран наивный байесовский классификатор, а именно MultinomialNB из модуля sklearn.naive_bayes?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Простота и высокая скорость обучения. Наивный байесовский классификатор обучается быстро, особенно на больших объемах данных. Это особенно важно в случае текстов, где количество признаков (слова) может быть очень велико.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Эффективность на коротких текстах. Наивный байесовский классификатор обычно работает хорошо, даже когда у вас ограниченное количество данных или когда тексты короткие. Это важно, например, в задачах анализа тональности коротких сообщений.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Хорошие результаты на практике. Несмотря на свою наивность и предположение о независимости признаков, MultinomialNB часто дает хорошие результаты в задачах текстовой классификации, особенно когда предположение о независимости относительно хорошо выполняется в данной задаче.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Работа с частотами слов. В задачах текстовой классификации часто используются частоты слов или их TF-IDF векторы. MultinomialNB хорошо работает с этими числовыми данными, так как его базовая предпосылка основана на мультиномиальном распределении, которое подходит для дискретных данных, таких как счетчики слов.\n",

       "  b'Subject: gas prices\\r\\nvince -\\r\\n1 . we can detect \" hoarding \" of pipeline capacity as an elevated basis against\\r\\nthe actual inflow .\\r\\n2 . we can detect \" market power \" by dissociating the seller from the buyer ,\\r\\ndistinguishing between the physical \" cost \" in gas to run the generators and\\r\\nthe transmission cost in dollars , i . e . the basis .\\r\\n3 . ( as you noted ) we can detect \" storage \" as the difference between inflow\\r\\nand consumption .\\r\\nit appears to me there are two time series needed for a straightforward model\\r\\nof gas prices : flow rates at interconnects ( from telemetry ) and spot - market\\r\\nprices . there is an elevated basis reflecting pipeline companies monopolizing\\r\\ncapacity , as well as hoarding of capacity by contracts . the dynamics of gas\\r\\nprices reflect consumption demand changes due to changes in expectations for\\r\\nthe weather , as well as their impact on two highly strategic behaviors :\\r\\nhoarding of pipeline capacity and storage of gas . we can \" calibrate \" the\\r\\nprice elasticity of demands for consumption and storage , and the price\\r\\nelasticities of demand for transmission , as well as the extent of hoarding ,\\r\\nfrom the two sets of numbers mentioned : flows and prices . what the basis\\r\\ntrader needs to understand are the incentives , and disincentives , for storage\\r\\nand capacity - hoarding , in terms of the calibrated price - elasticities , and\\r\\neach of these are as - if exotic call options at the consumption hub . finally ,\\r\\nflows are \" explained \" by the model , and can be imputed from prices if\\r\\nnecessary , resulting in a purely stochastic model of the basis in terms of\\r\\nthe weather .\\r\\ni believe the problem is quite tractable , and i would like to proceed with a\\r\\nmodel .\\r\\nclayton',\n",

       "  b'Subject: latest draft\\r\\ndon ,\\r\\nattached is my latest effort . it entailed fairly drastic \" restructuring\\r\\nand reorganization \" of the earlier draft . my revision effort has been\\r\\ndirected at improving the focus of the paper . the new story is the following :\\r\\n1 . enron was formed as a regulated gas pipeline company in the mid - eighties .\\r\\n2 . economic and competitive conditions conspired to force a dramatic\\r\\nreorganization of the company almost immediately . the result was the\\r\\ncreation of a new , unregulated energy trading operation . the strategy of\\r\\nthe new unit was to capitalize on business opportunities in the\\r\\nderegulation of markets that was occuring at the time ( mid - eighties until\\r\\nnow ) .\\r\\n3 . the business model adopted for the new unregulated business was that of\\r\\na \" gas bank \" . the analogy to a commercial bank posed a very difficult\\r\\nproblem to enron \\' s management in that there was no source of liquidity to\\r\\nthe market from a central bank authority . as a consequence enron had to\\r\\ndevelop its own very elaborate risk management procedures .\\r\\n4 . another consequence of the new business model was that it required a\\r\\ndifferent set of employee skills and talents . specifically , it required\\r\\nwere bright , energetic and innovative individuals capable of identifying\\r\\nentrepreneurial opportunities and starting new businesses . furthermore , a\\r\\nnew , flatter organizational structure entailing decentralized decision\\r\\nmaking was required to facilitate quick response to changing market\\r\\nconditions . to monitor and manage this new \" empowered \" labor force\\r\\nrequired that the firm develop new personnel policies and procedures .\\r\\n5 . three primary tools of personnel management were adopted : ( i ) measure\\r\\nperformance semi - annually , ( ii ) tie compensation closely to performance ,\\r\\nand ( iii ) allow personnel free movement within enron to seek out the best\\r\\nopportunities .\\r\\n6 . other attributes of the enron model include consideration for asset\\r\\noptionality , recognition of the value of networks in adding value to\\r\\ntrading platforms , and the use of mark - to - market accounting for business\\r\\ntransactions as a means of ensuring transparency and promoting prompt actions .\\r\\nif my \" story line \" sounds better than the draft i have attached its because\\r\\nits the last thing i \\' ve written . at any rate i look forward to hearing\\r\\nyour comments and to getting this wrapped up .\\r\\nthanks and i look forward to seeing you in february .\\r\\njohn\\r\\n- enron _ paper _ 1 _ 26 _ 01 . doc\\r\\njohn d . martin\\r\\ncarr p . collins chair in finance\\r\\nfinance department\\r\\nbaylor university\\r\\npo box 98004\\r\\nwaco , tx 76798\\r\\n254 - 710 - 4473 ( office )\\r\\n254 - 710 - 1092 ( fax )\\r\\nj _ martin @ baylor . edu\\r\\nweb : http : / / hsb . baylor . edu / html / martinj / home . html',\n",

term\\r\\ncontracts .\\r\\nour sources in washington , sacramento , and california are increasingly of the\\r\\nview that governor davis is positioning his government to establish long - term\\r\\npower contracts with the generators that could be passed through to the\\r\\nutilities following a bankruptcy in the near term . this week \\' s legislative\\r\\nactivities\\r\\nin sacramento will create the vehicle to do so . state credit backing\\r\\npurchases of power would obviate the need for super - priority borrowing to\\r\\nfinance power\\r\\npurchases after utility bankruptcy .\\r\\n1 . audit - untangling utility relationships\\r\\ncalifornia officials have also toughened their rhetoric on the debt repayment\\r\\nfront as they say results from a preliminary audit show that\\r\\nhalf of the $ 9 to $ 12 billion the utilities say they owe is actually owed to\\r\\nthemselves for power they bought from their corporate relations\\r\\nthis strange situation is due to the fact that one holding company owns both\\r\\nthe power - generating and power - distributing companies under a\\r\\nholding company umbrella . of course , that means that some of the power pg & e\\r\\nand southern california edison bought at highly inflated prices\\r\\nwas bought from themselves .\\r\\nbut it was not all bad news in the tense negotiations . sources confirm that\\r\\ndavis increasingly understood that the state finance role was a crucial part\\r\\nof any\\r\\npotential solution . he told our sources this afternoon that he is willing to\\r\\nuse state credit to eliminate the \" risky debt \" premium that pg & e\\r\\nand sce are being charged by suppliers because of their shaky finances and\\r\\nthat he is willing to extend the current 10 % rate increase\\r\\nutility customers are paying far beyond the initial 90 - day deadline . in\\r\\nreturn he is demanding that the companies prepare to \" share the\\r\\nburden of debt reduction in return for state help and credit extension . \"\\r\\n2 . debt restructuring - guarantees , but no direct state money\\r\\ndavis also told the videoconference that he believes the $ 12 billion in back\\r\\ndebt owed by the utility companies can be cleared up\\r\\nduring a 90 - day forbearance period ( whether that period has been agreed to by\\r\\nall creditors is not something we are clear about right now ) . davis \\' idea , as\\r\\nhe laid it out in the meeting , is to use the forbearance period to securitize\\r\\nthe debts and sell them against the utilities \\' forward rate base or by\\r\\nestablishing a\\r\\nmedium - term repayment plan backed by continued state guarantees .\\r\\nin both cases the restructured debt would be resolved over a decade without\\r\\ndirect use of taxpayer money as the utilities use their positive margins to\\r\\npaydown their debt . one of the reasons davis wants to stay close to the\\r\\n$ 50 - $ 55 megawatt charge is that it maximizes the rate at which utilities can\\r\\npay\\r\\ndown this debt . there is a strong chance that davis will agree to use state\\r\\nguarantees to sweeten the pot at the end of these negotiations , but he remains\\r\\nopposed to using direct state money . this frustrates both clinton\\r\\nadministration and utility creditors , but davis has not yet shown much\\r\\nflexibility .\\r\\n3 . eminent domain / reregulation\\r\\nperhaps most frustrating to the washington dc free market crowd at treasury\\r\\nand the white house was the continued comfort davis and his group of political\\r\\nadvisers have with \" non - market \" solutions to the energy crisis . although\\r\\nthe governor \\' s aides actually believe the weapon is more a \" way to force\\r\\neventual\\r\\nagreement , than an actual solution , \" the talk returns frequently to these\\r\\nnon - market mechanisms . \" we have the ultimate weapon to enforce compliance by\\r\\nthe\\r\\ntuesday deadline . if we make no progress . if this thing looks like it will\\r\\nturn into a genuine crisis , then we will use our powers of condemnation and\\r\\nwe will re - take\\r\\nthe plants and equipment and run them ourselves , \" a close political aide to\\r\\ndavis said . \" we will absorb the plants , the transmission lines and the\\r\\nreserved parking\\r\\nplaces of the executives . the legislature would agree in a second . \"',\n",

       "  b'Subject: 75 % reduction in road accidents\\r\\naugust , 2002\\r\\ndear sir / madam ,\\r\\nin case you have received this mail earlier , kindly ignore this mail . it may have\\r\\nbeen re - sent to you by mistake . ours is not a mailing list and we have no intention of sending any regular mails to anybody .\\r\\nwe have devised a set of systems , which can reduce the damage caused to vehicles and deaths and injury caused to passengers and pedestrians in vehicular accidents by more than\\r\\nseventy - five percent\\r\\nwe have already filed and are in process of filing further , multiple and appropriate disclosure documents , provisional patent applications at the united states patent & trademarks office ( uspto ) , and also applications under the patent co - operation treaty at world intellectual property organization ( wipo ) at geneva .\\r\\nthere is absolutely no doubt that our idea is new and innovative . moreover , we are very confident and very sure that this will help reducing / minimizing human suffering to a very large extent . there is no doubt that the product devised by us will change the face of the earth forever . brief details relating to our product are detailed in the annexures under the following headings :\\r\\nstatistics advantages\\r\\noptions\\r\\neconomics\\r\\nwe are looking for the followings :\\r\\n01 . business consultancy and advice regarding the most viable , practical and profitable course of action under the circumstances and also consultancy on patents one person moderately injured every three seconds ; one person mildly injured every three seconds . )\\r\\n( c ) current yearly automobile sales worldwide - more than 1000 billion us $ .\\r\\n( d ) number of automobiles worldwide - more than 1000 billion pieces\\r\\n( e ) daily loss caused due to vehicular accidents worldwide\\r\\nmore than 2 billion us $ per day .\\r\\n( 2 % of the worldwide gross national product of more than 36500 billion us $ = more than 730 us $ per year = more than 2 billion us $ per day )\\r\\ntheadvantages of the technology developed by us :\\r\\na . the introduction of such technology will dramatically reduce the expenses of auto - insurance . this reduction of insurance cost will be at par with or even more that the expenses incurred towards the introduction of such technology in modern day vehicles . accordingly , the life insurance premier will also undergo drastic reduction . additionally , because of saving of lives , the outgo of the insurance companies will reduce substantially .\\r\\nb . as per the who studies and projections , road accidents occupy the number nine positions by way of causes of death in the world today . it is projected by who that by the year 2020 they will occupy the number three positions , next only to heart disease and depression .\\r\\nby introduction of this technology , we are sure that this will not happen . on the contrary there will be massive reduction in the number of deaths due to road accidents and road accidents may not figure on the list of major causes of death , in the year 2020 at all .\\r\\nc . this technology will therefore , make all vehicles cheaper and safer . not only will the cost be reduced , safety which is priceless in itself , will also be greatly enhanced .\\r\\nas and when the regular patent application is filed and patent is granted , the life of the patent will be 20 years . even at the current levels , with road accidents placed at number nine on the who list as a major cause of death , there is a daily loss of two billion us $ . even at the present level , over a period of twenty years , without any interest and without any compounding , this loss works out to be :\\r\\n2 billion us $ x 365 days x 20 years - 14 , 600 billion us $ .\\r\\nd . our technology will ensure that at least seventy - five percent of the above losses are prevented . such figure works out to be more that 10 , 000 billion us $ . it is important to note that this is the projection at the current level . as per the future projections , the incidents of road accidents are expected to increase . hence , the figure is likely to be increase very substantially . in addition the time factor and the interest factor will inflate this figure further .\\r\\ne . at the current levels , more than 1 . 2 million persons are dying every year due to road accidents . even at the current rates , more than 24 million lives will be lost in road accidents over the next twenty years ( i . e . life of the patent , when granted ) . besides , at the current levels .\\r\\n3 . 2 million people are injured every year . in the next twenty years , the number of people injured due to road accident , will therefore be more than half a billion .\\r\\nf . if we add to that the personal , physical and psychological traumas to those directly involved in and also to those who are associated with the people involved in the road accidents . the trauma and the misery and henceforth the value of the savings , are all unmeasurable in quantities , presently known to human kind .\\r\\ng . considering the figures and dynamics as explained hereinabove , it may not be improper or out of place to compare this technology with the introduction of electricity , computer or aircrafts in terms of its value to mankind .\\r\\nh . the benefits of this technology will be so obvious and essential that , in the very near future , the use of this technology will become unavoidable . it should and will become mandatory by law , to install such technology and the installation of such technology should and will be a pre - requisite for granting or renewal of the registration and license of all vehicles in future .\\r\\ni . as described hereinabove ; this technology and its utility are incomparable , outthought of , and unheard of till date . it will open a new floodgate in human travel and safety measures . in future , it can and will be applied to other mode of transport , like aircrafts and trains also .\\r\\n. among other things , we have the following options available to us : - options\\r\\navailable to us : -\\r\\na - outright sale\\r\\n( a ) immediate outright sale of the idea and the concept along with our filed applications for one time lump sum consideration .\\r\\n( b ) further development of the concept and further filing of patent and all patent related applications , before taking steps as outlined in \" a \" .\\r\\nthe process ( b ) will obviously increase the realization in terms of price .\\r\\nb - licencing options\\r\\ni ) new vehicles - granting of licenses to manufacturers of automobiles , individually or collectively , all over the world for incorporation in the automobiles to be manufactured in future on fixed time or per piece basis .\\r\\nii ) conversion of existing vehicles - to independent agents for conversion of the existing more than 1000 billion vehicles all over the world .\\r\\nc - combined options\\r\\na collaborative arrangement with some private and / or government agency wherein we receive a certain down payment and then jointly distribute the licensing rights on a pre - decided sharing ( partnership ) arrangement .\\r\\nthe economics of the project will be as follows : -\\r\\n1 ) in case any / all processes and systems described by us are incorporated in the design of new vehicles and the new vehicles are manufactured in accordance with the modified designs , the cost escalation may not be more than 5 % to 8 % , and the safety and the protection will be ten times ( more than ) the price escalation . hence , drop in insurance premier will compensate for the cost escalation .\\r\\n2 ) in case , the existing vehicles are modified , the cost involved will be approximately 10 % to 15 % of the value of the vehicle .\\r\\nbut partial modifications at a lower cost , which will give partial protection , may also be carried out . as a thumb rule , the cost of modification in percentage terms will be about one fifth of the percentage of safety and protection provided .\\r\\n3 ) in case the value of the vehicles is low or the life of the vehicle is about to expire , the partial modifications may be practically and economically viable , as incorporation onto a new vehicle is relatively less expensive and more protective .\\r\\n4 ) there are more than 1000 billion motor vehicles in the world at present . besides there are an unspecified number of non - motorized ehicles .\\r\\n5 ) almost all of them can be converted in phased manner to a variable degree . the cost of conversion will be directly proportional to their current market value and the safety shield to be generated there from .\\r\\n6 ) among the motorised vehicles , the conversion cost may work out of few dollars for every percent of safety shield created the exact calculation can be worked out , but over all , some of the methods may provide more safety at lower cost compared to the other which may differ in efficiency .\\r\\n7 ) even if we consider a very vague and approximate cost of conversion of 300 us $ per vehicle , the conversion industry works out to be worth 3 , 00 , 000 billion us $ .\\r\\n8 ) realising the potential of the product in terms of human safety , it will be reasonable to presume that majority of such conversion will be completed over a period of three years from the starting date .\\r\\n9 ) as pointed hereinabove , the size of the conversion industry may be estimated to , in the range of 1 , 00 , 000 billion us $ per year over the next three years .\\r\\n10 ) alternatively , considering the diversity of available motorised vehicles all over the world , conversion licensing can also be commercially viable proposition . for such conversion , licenses can be granted on - line , on receipt of on - line payments . in that case , different rates for granting conversion to vehicles having specific registration numbers can be granted in accordance with and in proportion to the size , carrying capacity and the engine power of the vehicle .\\r\\n11 ) in case , licensing is done , the creation and installation of the concerned systems will be done by the end - user , as per his circumstances and needs . however , piracy is likely to be a major problem in such licensing .\\r\\n12 ) it is likely that as and when the systems are introduced in the motorised vehicles , unusual and unprecedented demand of new vehicles is created . this will result in massive rejection of the vehicles currently playing all over the world and stimulate an entirely new market as far as motorised vehicle is concerned . the size of such market is difficult to either comprehend and / or estimate .\\r\\np . s .\\r\\n1 ) some of the figures have been rounded off but generally the figures are correct .\\r\\n2 ) we have tried to keep this communication brief and to the point . more details , including website references are available with us and can be provided , if required .\\r\\n',\n",

supply estimates and several legal requirements and permissions .\\r\\nin fact , the committee has found that the mseb has been paying enron rs 930 crore more than it should every year . this comprises overcharging of rs 253 crore on account of the large regassification plant of which only 42 per cent of the capacity is used for dpc . there \\' s also a rs 100 crore extra billing to the mseb for shipping and harbour charges although the cost of these facilities had been included in the capital recovery charge . by charging more than twice the operations & maintenance rate stipulated by the government of india , enron collects approximately rs 246 crore extra every year . it has also been collecting rs 332 crore every year through inflated fuel consumption claims . enron has been charging at 1878 kcal / kwh under the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) although the equipment manufacturer has guaranteed it a much lower consumption rate . this gives it a fat fuel arbitrage opportunity at the cost of the people of maharashtra .\\r\\nthe committee has also pointed to the strange practice of using four different exchange rates for different aspects of the project negotiation : a rate of rs 32 per dollar was assumed for calculating debt service of rupee loans , rs 34 . 5 per dollar as reference rate for phase - i , rs 39 . 35 per dollar as reference rate for phase - ii and a curious rs 42 per dollar for calculating government of india tariff . forcing a reduction of these excessive charges has nothing to do with contract cancellation . all it needs is tough negotiation and public pressure on the political establishment .\\r\\nthe godbole committee has established that dpc \\' s tariffs can easily be halved if excess payments are eliminated and unfair conditions such as the dollarisation of payments , the take - or - pay clause and escrow facility ( which is in fact hampering mseb \\' s reform particularly in power distribution ) are scrapped . the security of future payments to dpc under the restructured tariff would be based on increased cash flows from a reformed distribution system . the committee also gives enron a difficult escape route . it says that if the multinational finds the conditions for restructuring too onerous , it should free mseb from its contractual obligations and find buyers outside maharashtra . the committee has tried to establish another precedent on all projects negotiated by government : \" the public has a right to know what is being contracted on their behalf \" and has recommended that all documents , including contracts related to all independent power projects ( ipps ) , particularly dpc , should be published by the maharashtra government within two months .\\r\\nalso , having established that demand - supply estimates by the state government were fanciful , the committee has asked mseb to defer all negotiations with power producers until demand levels in the state permit full absorption of power generation from such ipps . it recommends that such negotiations should be in accordance with the least - cost plan spelt out by the report . this should also end the hectic lobbying by reliance ( patalganga ) , mittals ( bhadravati ) , the bses ( saphale ) and others to set up ipps in maharashtra .\\r\\n- -

in - fact \" and authorise him to represent the company in the negotiation of all project contracts and financing agreements and their amendments and modifications . top sources told the financial express that dpc would authorise mr cline and / or mr mcgregor to serve the preliminary termination notices and transfer notices to the state and central governments and mseb under clause 17 and schedule 11 of the ppa .\\r\\n\" in response to the continuing default by the mseb of its payment obligations under the ppa , the failure of the government of maharashtra to honour obligations under its guarantee and state support agreement and failure of the government of india to honour obligations under its counter guarantee , the company has sought recourse to dispute resolution and has initiated conciliation and arbitration proceedings , \" the company resolution said . \" consistent with this recourse to contractual remedies , the company now seeks the authority to serve preliminary termination notices and transfer notices pursuant to clause 17 and schedule 11 of the ppa from time to time and at any time upon the occurrence of an event giving rise to its right to serve such notices as determined by the company , \" the resolution added .\\r\\naccording to the resolution , the directors , the company secretary and officers of the company and each of them acting individually , are authorised and empowered to execute and deliver such documents and instruments and take such other actions as they deem fit to effect the purpose of the resolution , in the name and for and on behalf of the company . against this backdrop , the state government and mseb have been exploring the possibilities of issuing termination notice to the dpc for its failure to meet the contractual obligations under the ppa . the state government and mseb sources said that such a notice could be served by the mseb as dpc has not paid the rebate ( penalty ) of rs 409 crore for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power on january 28 and february 13 .\\r\\nthe state government and mseb , which reviewed its position on saturday at a meeting convened by the chief minister vilasrao deshmukh , are of the view that they have a strong case and substantial grounds to slap the termination notice to the dpc . the dpc \\' s move to appoint mr k wade cline as its \" true and lawful attorney - in - fact \" deserves importance especially when the state government proposes to set up a negotiating committee to cut the per unit cost and gauge the possibility of sale of dabhol power to the power deficit states .\\r\\nmr cline would also be authorised to dispose of equipment that is worn out or obsolete or other equipment or fuel no longer expected to be used in the ordinary course in amounts exceeding rs 64 crore or the equivalent in foreign currency in any financial year . furthermore , mr cline would be in a position to enter into contracts and take any other actions for purpose relating to the day -

energy review committee headed by former home secretary madhav godbole\\r\\nthis could well be the real enron story\\r\\na five - member high - powered committee headed by madhav godbole - and including former union economic affairs secretary e . a . s . sarma , hdfc chairman deepak parekh , teri chairman rajendrapachauri and maharashtra government official vinay mohan lal - has recommended a judicial probe into the entire enron power project deal saying it signified \" the utter failure of governance that seems to have characterised almost every step of the decision - making process relating to the dabhol project \" . the report , which was submitted to the maharashtra government last fortnight and has been acquired by outlook , is severely critical of former chief minister sharad pawar ( with the congress then ) , the 13 - day bjp - led union government which reworked the deal in 1996 , shiv sena supremo balasaheb thackeray and his government in maharashtra headed by manohar joshi\\r\\n\" the utter failure of governance seems to have characterised almost every step of decision - making relating to the dabhol project . \" madhav godbole committee report\\r\\nan investigation , if ordered , could embarrass at least these three governments the report clearly upholds the allegations of money being paid by enron to politicians and bureaucrats for clinching the deal . according to the committee , the deal reveals failure of governance , both at the centre and state , and across different agencies . \" it strains belief to accept that such widespread and consistent failure to execute responsibilities is purely coincidental , \" the report said , proposing a set of measures to be implemented if something of the project was to be retrieved . godbole and sarma also felt that the panel should categorically recommend the government of india to order a judicial inquiry . this was finally adopted by it . says a congress leader : \" enron could well become the biggest political issue in maharashtra and put to question liberalisation , particularly in the power sector . \"\\r\\nthe proposal has already struck panic . says ncp \\' s praful patel : \" if the enron decision has at all been detrimental , it is because of the haste with which phase 2 was cleared by the shiv sena - bjp government . now with the state having already entered into an agreement with enron , the important thing is to resolve it amicably . a judicial inquiry will be an eyewash because it \\' s not an issue of corruption but that of perception . \"\\r\\npro - market congressmen privately admit that it was their governments at the centre and the state which invited enron , even though the second phase was cleared by the bjp - shiv sena combine . says congress spokesperson jaipal reddy : \" right now we \\' re too involved with the parliament deadlock over tehelka . \" pro - liberalisation congress mps also fear that such witch - hunting could send wrong signals to foreign investors . non - congress mps from maharashtra , meanwhile , claim that the godbole committee was instituted with the express purpose of politicising the enron issue . \" i think i know vilasrao deshmukh \\' s gameplan , \" says an mp from the state . but some mps like congress \\' prithviraj chavan question the cloak of secrecy that \\' s surrounded the deal : \" i \\' ve maintained for long that there should be a judicial committee to examine this \" .\\r\\nthe committee report also says that had the enron project been subjected to a techno - economic appraisal , as envisaged under provisions of the electricity supply act of 1948 and related legislations , the infirmities could have been avoided . since this wasn \\' t done , questions about a concerted effort towards exercising undue influence at every stage of the project are bound to arise , the exhaustive 93 - page report points out .\\r\\n\" i \\' d highlight the speed with which the 13 - day vajpayee government cleared the project minutes before it quit , \" says congress mp prithviraj chavan .\\r\\nthe enron project had been held out as an exemplar of the impending liberalisation in the early \\' 90 s and , despite several controversies , is now an established power project at dabhol , 150 km south of mumbai . in july 1992 , enron signed an mou with the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) to set up a 2 , 550 mw station as part of the government \\' s \\' fast track \\' projects .\\r\\nsubsequently , when the shiv - sena - bjp came to power in maharashtra it filed a writ against the project . this curiously led to renegotiations with enron . the committee has quoted a bombay high court order on the renegotiated deal . \" once it ( gom ) decided to revive the project , it acted in the very same manner its predecessors in office had done . it forgot all about competitive bidding and transparency . the speed with which the negotiating group studied the project and made its proposal for renegotiatons , which was accepted by dabhol , is unprecedented . \" says chavan : \" i would particularly like to highlight the speed with which the 13 - day vajpayee government at centre endorsed the renegotiated project minutes before it resigned . \"\\r\\nsince the commissioning of the plant in may 1999 , the mseb has paid rs 1 , 607 crore for the power it has bought from dabhol . if the same watttage of power had been bought from indian - built power plants fired by indigenous coal , the payment would have been approximately rs 736 crore . in the first year - and - a - half of its operation itself , the dpc had drained the maharashtra exchequer of nearly rs 1 , 000 crore .\\r\\nthe central electricity authority ( cea ) , in fact , pointed out that the dabhol plant was not the least costly option . the mseb had other inexpensive alternatives like the four units of kaparkheda , but they were in a preliminary stage . the report notes : \" . . . if the mseb had made efforts to seriously pursue these projects , they might not have remained in their preliminary stages \" . it adds that the members were of the opinion that \" the mseb and the maharashtra government erred seriously , based on information available at that time , in proceeding with the dpc as a base - load factor even when its capacity was reduced . \" the failure seems to have been compounded by the laxity of the union power ministry , finance ministry and the cea . it quotes the cea as saying that since the union finance ministry found the tariff reasonable , no further examination was required\\r\\nstrangely , bal thackeray \\' s shiv sena , when it came to power together with the bjp in maharashtra , filed a writ in the court and then renegotiated the deal .\\r\\nafter the new shiv sena - bjp government took over , its cm , manohar joshi , appointed a renegotiating committee in 1996 which made the right noises , actually managing to reduce the tariff . but certain things remained inexplicable . no fresh clearances were required from the cea , which also said that \" since no cost increase was involved . . . fresh formal clearance wasn \\' t necessary . \" says the committee : \" this only adds strength to the suspicion that the cea didn \\' t consider the economic aspects of the project at all . indeed , given the non - availability of any official record of the meeting on june 24 , 1994 , with the committee and the nature of this letter dated december 23 , 1994 , the committee is doubtful whether the economic aspects of dpc were discussed at all . \\' \\'\\r\\nthe credibility of the shiv sena - bjp government has been seriously questioned . \" the committee finds it unexplicable ( sic ) why there was no mention of any reduction in capital cost of the project from $ 2 , 828 million to $ 2 , 501 million as agreed by dpc in the summary report of the renegotiating committee , \" the panel observes . says lawyer prashant bhushan : \" it is strange that the shiv sena - bjp government first filed a writ in the court and then coolly renegotiated the deal . \" the committee further spells out the losses incurred through the deal . \" subsequent to the commissioning of the dpc , the financial deterioration of mseb has been rapid . while the mseb was in profit in 1998 - 99 , it plunged into huge losses of rs 1681 crore in 1999 - 2000 . \"\\r\\nsignificantly , the world bank in 1993 had predicted the system \\' s inherent weaknesses . in a letter written to the then power secretary , r . vasudevan , a top bank official had said that \" after a detailed review of the analytical framework and costing assumptions , we reconfirm our earlier conclusion that the dabhol project , as presently formulated , is not economically justified \" and that in \" our assessment the project is too large to enter the mseb system in 1998 . the proposed base - load operation could result in uneconomic plant dispatch , as already existing lower variable cost coal power would be replaced by the higher cost lng power . \"\\r\\nenron \\' s persistence and the \\' gullibility \\' of the indian side can be gauged from high - ranking enron official joe sutton \\' s letter to a key indian official , ajit nimbalkar : \" i recently met with the world bank and have been following the articles in the india papers . i feel that the world bank opinion can be changed . we \\' ll engage a pr firm and hopefully manage the media from here on . the project has solid support from all other agencies in washington . \"\\r\\nthe key question in the enron deal is whether a developed state like maharashtra needs outside intervention in the power sector at all ? for the first time the godbole committee has raised objections about the viability of such a project . according to the report , the mseb has been one of the better performing boards in the country and has , despite a faulty transmission and distribution ( t and d ) system , managed to consistently earn net revenue surpluses on an accrual basis .\\r\\nmaharashtra accounts for nearly one - fourth of the gross value of india \\' s industrial sector . it \\' s one of the few states to achieve 100 per cent electrification . since \\' 95 , the mseb has been adding to its generation . \" this improvement , which has been largely due to renovation and modernisation undertaken by the mseb , exceeded its own expectations at a time when the dpc was being considered , \" the report points out . following a policy of cross - subsidy , roughly nine out of its ten users are subsidised .\\r\\nbut the gap between the average cost of supply and average realisation hasn \\' t been much . in fact , the subsidy claim decreased from rs 630 crore in 1995 - 96 to rs 355 crore in 1998 - 99 , until in 1999 - 2000 it increased nearly five - fold to rs 2 , 084 crore due to the sudden increase in the gap by 26 paise per unit - from 15 to 41 paise - an increase of 173 per cent . \" the increase in the subsidy claim by rs 1 , 729 crore is due to the increase in the gap principally because of the increase in power purchase costs , \" says the committee , adding : \" without the dpc and without problems of t and d loss , the mseb could be financially healthy . \"\\r\\nbut can that happen now since enron is here to stay ? the committee has come up with some far - reaching recommendations : make public all dabhol - related documents and agreements , restructure the dabhol project itself to bring down the cost of power , restructure dpc financially , allow sale of dpc power outside maharashtra , re - examine ppas in accordance with least - cost plans , and thoroughly reform the mseb . the committee know this can become reality only with political consensus and through forming of public opinion . the question is , can that be achieved in an unstable political environment ?\\r\\nwith priya sahgal\\r\\nmaking of a scam\\r\\n? 1992 : centre invites enron to set up \\' fast track \\' power project\\r\\n? dec 1993 : first ppa signed with mseb\\r\\n? 1994 : enron starts construction\\r\\n? 1995 : sena -

- pegged at nearly 20 , 000 disconnections a month - - which resulted in compliance by consumers . with the dabhol power company ( dpc ) monthly financial burden issue now a topic of discussion among arbitrators on the negotiating table , the mseb has turned to putting its house in order .\\r\\nas if to ward of any criticism of its fiscal condition that could be termed as the facilitator to the entire dpc tariff crisis , the state electricity board has put matters relating to its performance on record . for instance , mseb has recorded the highest power generation in the year ended march 31 , 2001 , at 45930 units , compared with the previous year \\' s 45582 units , making it the top seb of the country in this respect . similarly its power stations recorded the highest availability percentage at 86 . 1 up from 84 . 6 per cent last fiscal . plant load factor is up to 72 . 78 per cent , compared with 71 . 7 per cent in 2000 .\\r\\nthe parli power station has recorded the highest ever generation in the ten years of its life time in 2000 at 4545 million units , which made it eligible for the meritorious productivity award under the eligibility guidelines issued by the government of india carrying a cash award of rs 12 . 5 lakh . all other power stations in the state , without exception , also fulfill the eligibility criteria for the cash award , a senior mseb official said . similarly , the chandrapur power station became the first power station of any state electricity board to get the iso 9002 certification .\\r\\na senior mseb official said : \" earlier mseb was suffering from too much interference in its day to day functioning . the agriculturists were touted as the major reason for its deteriorating accruals , while theft of electricity during the transmission and distribution stage was conveniently camouflaged under this head . in the recent past , the government has authorised mseb to take steps to curb this misuse of power by its own officials , many of whom , including a chief engineer have suffered suspensions',\n",

       "  b'Subject: lng by rail\\r\\nvince ,\\r\\ni was thinking about the type of things you could be talking to jeff shankman\\r\\nabout , in the dabhol lng context . it occurred to me that one way to collect\\r\\non regas charges , and still find alternate cutomers for gas is through the\\r\\nrailways .\\r\\nsome time back , i had looked into the possiblility of transporting lng by\\r\\ntrain . apparently , technology exists wherein lng can be put into cryogenic\\r\\ncontainers that can be trucked as well as the same containers being loaded\\r\\nfrom trucks to train bogies . i believe this maybe a way to earn some monies\\r\\nwith lng by developing just such a market in india for commercial customers .\\r\\nit is pertinent to note that the konkan rail line is just about 1 hr . 45\\r\\nminutes from the dabhol plant . trucks from dabhol could carry lng to the\\r\\nrail line at guhagar from where it could travel up and down the west coast of\\r\\nindia . if we target end - consumers directly , we could easily sell at retail\\r\\ntype prices , and build in a large margin , even if the volumes disposed are\\r\\nrelatively smaller . ( the alternative fuel for most of these establishments\\r\\nis diesel or naphtha which is highly priced , and mostly trucked along\\r\\nroads , increasing costs ) . the end aim is to keep income targets in india , so\\r\\nthat the analysts do not have a field day with the stock .\\r\\nhence keeping activity up in india , and showing that solutions exist , will\\r\\nkeep stock price buoyed . we could explore this idea if it appeals !\\r\\nregards ,\\r\\nsandeep .',\n",

       "  b\"Subject: data for moody ' s riskcalc\\r\\ncraig and kim ,\\r\\nas you know , i have obtained a 60 day trial subscription to moody ' s riskcalc .\\r\\nyou wanted to know if it makes sense for enron to purchase riskcalc .\\r\\nwell , after plowing through their 100 page manual and sitting through today ' s 2 - hour moody ' s presentation , it is necessary for us to have information about enron ' s counterparties to move to the next step with riskcalc .\\r\\nwe have obtained some information on enron ' s european counterparties from our colleagues in the london office .\\r\\nwe need for you and / or your colleagues in the houston office to supply us with a list of enron ' s north american counterparties .\\r\\nmore specifically , to evaluate moody ' s riskcalc we will need the following financial inputs for enron ' s north american ( private firm ) counterparties :\\r\\nfiscal year\\r\\nthe prior twelve months of financial data are represented . annual statements are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables , such as cost of goods sold , net income , sales , and ebit . the value should be a four - digit integer year without mention of the day or month such as 1999 or 2000 . forecasts until the year 2009 can be made . a constant rate of inflation is applied to future years using last year ' s ( 1999 ) inflation level . in general this ' estimation error ' will not cause any great problems , as size affects default rates at very large scales ( e . g . , $ 10 , 000 , 000 vs . $ 1 , 000 , 000 makes a significant difference , $ 1 , 000 , 000 vs . $ 1 , 050 , 00 does not ) .\\r\\ncash & equivalents\\r\\nthis measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities .\\r\\ninventory\\r\\ninventories are taken directly from the balance sheet , in thousands dollars , without any alterations for accounting method ( e . g . , lifo , fifo , average cost ) . this item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and supplies purchased for use in production of revenue . specifically this would include purchase cost , sales cost , sales taxes , transportation costs , insurance costs , and storage costs .\\r\\ncurrent assets\\r\\nthis item primarily represents cash , inventories , accounts receivables , marketable securities , and other current assets .\\r\\ntotal assets\\r\\ntotal assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars . for example , $ 15 , 500 , 000 should be entered as 15500 . specifically , total assets are the sum of current assets plus net property , plant , and equipment plus other noncurrent assets ( including intangible assets , deferred items , and investments and advances ) . leave previous year ' s total assets blank for australian companies .\\r\\ncurrent liabilities\\r\\nliabilities are positive values . included in current liabilities are short - term debt , accounts payable , and other current liabilities .\\r\\ntotal liabilities\\r\\nthis balance sheet account , total liabilities , is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus long - term debt plus other noncurrent liabilities ( including deferred taxes , investment tax credit , and minority interest ) .\\r\\nretained earnings\\r\\nretained earnings , a historical measure of performance , is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders . typically , it is the prior year ' s retained earnings plus net income less distributions . retained earnings are generally positive . some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings . leave this field blank for australian companies .\\r\\nsales\\r\\nthis item consists of the industry segment ' s gross sales ( the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period ) reduced by cash discounts , trade discounts , and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers .\\r\\ncost of goods sold\\r\\nentered in thousands of dollars , this value is generally a positive number less than sales . it represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production , such as material , labor , and overhead . not fixed overhead or items that would be included in selling , general , and administrative expenses . leave this field blank for australian companies .\\r\\nebit\\r\\nearning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation . it can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income .\\r\\ninterest expense\\r\\nthis item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short - and long - term debt . typically , we expect this charge to be approximately the prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities . one measure of computing this is : interest expense = 0 . 07 * total liabilities .\\r\\nnet income\\r\\nthis item represents the income ( or loss ) reported by a company after expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations . a loss is represented by a negative sign . for example , a $ 5 , 000 , 000 loss would be entered as - 5000 . leave previous year ' s net income blank for australian companies .\\r\\nextraordinary items\\r\\npositive or negative , this item represents unusual items that sometimes appear on the income statement . the items are designated by the company as extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and discontinued operations . these items include extraordinary gains / losses , income ( loss ) from discontinued operations , and cumulative affect of accounting changes . expenses are entered as negative values , gains as positive values . leave previous year ' s extraordinary items blank for australian companies .\\r\\ncountry\\r\\nthis model is calibrated for the united states , canada , and australia .\\r\\nwe look forward to receiving this information for enron ' s private firm north american counterparties so that we can move on to the next step with the evaluation of riskcalc .\\r\\nthanks ,\\r\\niris\",\n",

( datedbrentcrude - 18 . 8 ) + constant ,\\r\\nwhere n is 14 , 15 or 16\\r\\n[ reddish curves ]\\r\\nr - squared approx 0 . 49\\r\\nf - stat approx 32\\r\\nthe chart below shows what our projected pllu curve would be given this\\r\\nequation , and also the three best relations from before which were based upon\\r\\ncurrent and future rpi :\\r\\npllu ( t ) = a . rpi ( t ) + b . rpi ( t + n ) + constant , where n is 14 , 15 or 16\\r\\n[ greenish curves ]\\r\\nr - squared approx 0 . 47\\r\\nf - stat approx 45\\r\\ncomparison of models\\r\\nas you can see , the two equations differ in the very short - term and very\\r\\nlong - term ; the inclusion of deviations of brent crude leads to short - term\\r\\npredictions of 3 . 0 % to 3 . 2 % over the next six months . the greenish curves\\r\\npredict pllu in the range of 2 . 5 % to 2 . 8 % over the next six months .\\r\\nthe curves are then very similar until 2009 , when the models including crude\\r\\nbreak - away to the upside , relative to the falling rpi curve . the model based\\r\\npurely on rpi hugs the rpi curve much more closely in the longer term . this\\r\\nis only important to the extent that we have large positions beyond 2009\\r\\n( which we don \\' t ) .\\r\\nsuggestion\\r\\nwhat could be useful now is a differently - specified model designed to\\r\\nforecast only the next 3 months , using auto - regressive or auto - regressive\\r\\nerror terms . this model would be far more accurate in the near - term , and we\\r\\ncould include this information onto the front of this long - term model . this\\r\\nmay be useful , despite the fact that most of our exposure is in future time\\r\\nbuckets .\\r\\nback - testing\\r\\nall the models give similar visual and statistical performance over the data\\r\\nsample used ( based mainly on 1990 s \" new paradigm \" economy ) .\\r\\nhopefully we can discuss these and other points later in the tele - conference ;\\r\\nyour ideas on this would be appreciated .\\r\\nregards ,\\r\\nanjam\\r\\nx 35383',\n",

to - market ( document link : wade cline )\\r\\nsandeep :\\r\\ni met with bob today and discussed the deal structure we put together . on\\r\\nthe mark - to - market issue , bob and his colleague wess told me that as long as\\r\\npayments are tied to one particular plant , we cannot m - t - m them . they had same\\r\\nproblem with plants here in the us ( like the peaking plants ) and they had to\\r\\nseparate the plant from power sales to be able to m - t - m the assocated\\r\\ncashflows .\\r\\nwhat they did is : they sold power from the plant to an outside party and\\r\\nbought\\r\\nit back from them at completely different ( multiple ) locations . the buyback is\\r\\nnot tied to any specific plant and is marked to maket . even if enron can\\r\\nsomehow\\r\\nmark - to - market a deal with dpc , it can do so for only 50 % of the cashflows\\r\\nbecause only 50 % of dpc is owned by outsiders . and a simple loan to an\\r\\naffiliate cannot also be marked to market .\\r\\nbob was suggesting that if eipl buys options from dpc and from some other\\r\\nplants and in turn sells power to ap or karnataka then we could have a case\\r\\nfor\\r\\nm - t - m . politically dpc selling power to eipl may not be the best solution , to\\r\\nput it rather mildly !\\r\\nour alternatives , as i see them , are\\r\\n1 . do the deal as we structured it . the only difference is that enron doesn \\' t\\r\\nmark it to market and income is earned only in 2002 - 03 .\\r\\n2 . do the deal as we structured it . eipl / enron then sells the contract to\\r\\nanother party at a profit . the problem , of course , is finding this party and\\r\\nforking part of the profit to them .\\r\\n3 . same deal , except revenue securitization is done through an outside party\\r\\nin\\r\\nindia ( not eipl ) .\\r\\nbob said he will think about the issues some more this week . let me know when\\r\\nyou will be here next week so we can meet with bob together . i will be going\\r\\nto\\r\\nboston for tuesday and / or wednesday ( feb . 1 -

to - market\\r\\nbob ,\\r\\ni wanted to continue the analysis on mark - to - market that i had spoken to you\\r\\nabout on the phone .\\r\\ni thought that it was getting very difficult explaining the whole transaction\\r\\nby\\r\\nphone , so i am having krishnarao who is in vince \\' s group explain the\\r\\ntransaction\\r\\nto you .\\r\\nkrishna has been helping us structure the deal here in india , and he has just\\r\\nreturned to houston from india after working with the team here .\\r\\nhe will seek an appointment with you to explain the transaction . i would like\\r\\nyou to please spend some time with him , and then based on the discussion\\r\\nplease\\r\\nsend us a note detailing how sucha a transaction would be marked to market .\\r\\nplease cosider the fact that currently there are no such transactions from the\\r\\nindian side . this is a very important transaction for us , and we may need to\\r\\nrepeat this in coming months , hence setting up the system to account for these\\r\\nmaybe well worth it . also , what i am concerned about is that there will be an\\r\\nenron india ( eipl ) account in india based on indian gaap , and upon\\r\\nconsolidation\\r\\nthere will be a us gaap accounting in the us . it is here that we would like\\r\\nto\\r\\nhave mark - to - market accounting . eipl is structured through mauritius , and\\r\\nthen\\r\\ncaymen islands .\\r\\nanother key question to consider is that when we m - t - m the transaction in the\\r\\nus\\r\\nthere will be a tax accruing in the year of m - t - m ( say 2000 ) . however , in\\r\\nindia , as a result of the accrual accounting , there will not be any income\\r\\nshowing till the year 2002 or 2003 . we will need to know how that would get\\r\\ntreated , and whether there is a way to get credit for the tax payable in the\\r\\nus .\\r\\ni am also confused about whether us tax would be levied , since none of the\\r\\nincome is being brought back into the us ( remains overseas - subpart - f and\\r\\nother\\r\\nconcerns ) .\\r\\nfinally , we have been working hard in structuring a fixed price contract and\\r\\ngetting a fixed for floating swap in the us ( this is still not allowed to\\r\\nindian\\r\\ncorporates ) . i need you to think about this too , and see if some type of\\r\\naccounting will solve this issue . krishna knows what i am talking about , and\\r\\nwill brief you on the same .\\r\\nkrishna - please walk bob through the three structures we had worked here .\\r\\nlook forward to your help and comments . this is going to be an exciting\\r\\nproject\\r\\nfor us all .\\r\\nregards ,\\r\\nsandeep .',\n",

depth understanding of the pricing and risk\\r\\nmanagement of energy derivatives . in the remainder of this chapter we give\\r\\nan overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy\\r\\nassets , and which underlie the rest of the book . as well as introducing\\r\\nthe techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we\\r\\ndiscuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo\\r\\nsimulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the\\r\\nbook .\\r\\nin chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices . apart from describing\\r\\nempirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model\\r\\nthe prices . we look at the well - know process of gbm as well as mean\\r\\nreversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each , and\\r\\nshowing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated .\\r\\nchapter 3 , written by vince kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of\\r\\nenron corporation , discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity\\r\\nmarkets . this chapter builds on the previous one . it examines in detail\\r\\nthe methods , merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process\\r\\nassuming different pricing models introduced in chapter 2 . examples\\r\\nfrom crude , gas , and electricity markets are used to illustrate the\\r\\ntechnical and interpretative aspects of calculating volatility .\\r\\nchapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . although such\\r\\ncurves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets\\r\\nthe difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined\\r\\ncurves . what we do in this chapter\\r\\nchapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not - so - common derivative\\r\\nstructures in the energy markets and discusses their uses . examples of\\r\\nproducts analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors\\r\\nand collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian ( or\\r\\naverage rate ) options , barriers , lookbacks , and ladder options .\\r\\nchapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot\\r\\nprice and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . closed form\\r\\nsolutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option\\r\\nprices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter\\r\\nincluding a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate\\r\\nmodel with jumps .\\r\\nchapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options\\r\\ncan be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . simulation schemes are\\r\\ndeveloped for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a\\r\\nvariety of path dependent options . in order to price options which\\r\\nincorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is\\r\\ndeveloped . this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward\\r\\ncurve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard american style\\r\\noptions .\\r\\nchapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on\\r\\nmodelling the market observed forward curve . the approach results in a\\r\\nmulti - factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a\\r\\nwide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility\\r\\nstructures can be of an extremely general form . closed - form solutions are\\r\\ndeveloped for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo\\r\\nschemes for exotic options . the chapter finishes with a discussion of the\\r\\nvaluation of american style options .\\r\\nchapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions .\\r\\nin this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions\\r\\nthat sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced\\r\\nwith the problem of managing the risk through time . we begin with delta\\r\\nhedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma\\r\\nhedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7 . the general model of\\r\\nchapter 7 ideally suited to multi - factor hedging and this is also\\r\\ndiscussed .\\r\\nchapter 10 looks at the key risk - management concept of value at risk\\r\\napplied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios . after\\r\\ndiscussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs\\r\\n( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then\\r\\ncompare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta ,\\r\\ndelta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation . finally , we\\r\\nlook at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market\\r\\nvariables .\",\n",

       "  b'Subject: sap timesheets\\r\\nhello everyone :\\r\\nthanks to krishna we have come up with a plan that i believe is going to\\r\\nsave everyone some time . we have created an excel spreadsheet , with\\r\\nthe time sheet form , and there is a tab for each of you , in alphabetical\\r\\norder\\r\\nby first name across the bottom of the spreadsheet .\\r\\nthe spreadsheet is saved in o : \\\\ research \\\\ common \\\\ sap timesheets \\\\ mmm - dd .\\r\\n( mmm = month and dd = 15 th or end of the month time period - i . e . , this time\\r\\nperiod is 7 / 16 - 7 / 31 / 00 ) . the regular 8 hour days have already been entered\\r\\nfor each of you . therefore , if you have no exceptions you just need to type\\r\\nin\\r\\nyour name in the bottom right corner by the place marked ( emp sign ) , and save\\r\\nit .\\r\\nif you do have exception time , simply open that particular pay period and\\r\\nshow the exception time ( off - duty , vacation , overtime , sick time , jury time ,\\r\\nfamily\\r\\ntime , etc . ) that you may have had during that pay period . some of the codes\\r\\nhave already been entered for you , the rest are listed at the bottom of the\\r\\nspreadsheet and just change the ones that are already there for whatever\\r\\napplies .\\r\\nif you are an exempt employee you need only show your off - duty time\\r\\nor exception time . if you are non - exempt you must show all hours worked\\r\\nand if you have overtime , you must add that to the 8 hours regular time .\\r\\nthere is no code for non - exempt overtime .\\r\\nthis should make it much easier for everyone . however , i will need you to\\r\\nfill out this timesheet form by the 13 th and 29 th of each month . i will\\r\\ntry and remind you by email the day before .\\r\\ni would still appreciate your emailing me of any vacation , hod day , or any\\r\\nother\\r\\noff - duty that you know about before hand , that way if you are out of pocket\\r\\nfor any\\r\\nreason and cannot fill in one of the forms , i will be able to fill in your\\r\\ntimesheet for you .\\r\\nif you have any questions or suggestions , please let me know .\\r\\nthanks !\\r\\nshirley',\n",

       "  b'Subject: extending eu gas guidelines to central and eastern europe - cera\\r\\ninsight\\r\\ntitle : extending eu gas guidelines to central and eastern europe\\r\\nurl : http : / / www 20 . cera . com / eprofile ? u = 35 & m = 2184\\r\\noverview : a comprehensive reform of gas legislation in central and eastern\\r\\neurope is bringing the region in line with the european union \\x01 , s gas\\r\\ndirective . this is true both for the countries expected to enter the union by\\r\\n2004 \\x01 ) 05 \\x01 * czech republic , estonia , hungary , poland , and slovenia - - and for\\r\\ncandidates whose entry is not scheduled before the end of the\\r\\ndecade - - bulgaria , latvia , lithuania , romania , and slovakia . in cera \\x01 , s view\\r\\ncurrent developments regarding the establishment of a legal framework for the\\r\\ninternal gas market in eastern and central europe look promising from an\\r\\ninvestor \\x01 , s point of view .\\r\\nthe candidate countries presented a review of progress made in the\\r\\nimplementation of the eu gas directive during a two - day workshop held by the\\r\\neuropean commission and the world bank in paris in november .\\r\\nmany of these countries have been reforming their energy industries\\r\\nthroughout the 1990 s as part of their transition to a market economy . the\\r\\nresults have been mixed , particularly in the utility industries . the 1998 gas\\r\\ndirective ( adopted in august 2000 ) now offers a compelling incentive for eu\\r\\ncandidate countries to transform their gas industries , while providing a road\\r\\nmap to guide them .\\r\\nthe critical points relevant to harmonization between the european union and\\r\\ncandidate countries include the following :\\r\\n* legal framework and regulation . the legal framework is the cornerstone of\\r\\nenlargement and the yardstick of harmonization in europe . as a result , in all\\r\\ncandidate countries in 1999 \\x01 ) 2000 energy laws were either updated or newly\\r\\nestablished along the principles spelled out in the gas directive . regulatory\\r\\nbodies have been created by law and are operating in every country , although\\r\\nissues of staffing , financial autonomy , and independence from political\\r\\ninfluence are not uniformly resolved .\\r\\n* third - party access ( tpa ) and long - term take - or - pay contracts . all candidate\\r\\ncountries agree that tpa is a key to market competition . therefore , all have\\r\\nadopted it or intend to do so in their new legislation . although the\\r\\ncommission favors regulated tpa , the specific approaches to tpa enforcement\\r\\nin the candidate countries remain unclear in some cases . in particular , the\\r\\nimplementation of tpa will have to address the issue of long - term take - or - pay\\r\\ncontracts with russia that were signed by all major domestic gas companies\\r\\nand somewhat preempt competition . russian gas is for the most part sold to\\r\\nsingle , traditional state - owned operators that dominate their internal\\r\\nmarkets . a balance will need to be struck between these incumbent dominant\\r\\nplayers and the competitive environment . this is made more complicated by\\r\\ntheir ownership of large volumes of russian gas supplied in kind in exchange\\r\\nfor transit rights to west european customers . article 25 of the directive\\r\\nprovides for !\\r\\na derogation to companies experiencing difficulties stemming from take - or - pay\\r\\nobligations . this derogation would apply to the companies of candidate\\r\\ncountries with historical and commercial links with the russian gas industry .\\r\\nfurthermore , article 26 allows derogations to those member states with only\\r\\none major gas supplier , to those with an \\x01 + \\x01 + emerging gas market\\r\\nstatus , \\x01 , \\x01 , or to those without a direct gas connection to the grid of another\\r\\nmember state . most of the candidate countries would in principle be able to\\r\\ncall on one or more of these grounds for derogation when they join the\\r\\neuropean union .\\r\\n* price cross - subsidies . residential gas tariffs are artificially low and are\\r\\nfinanced partially through higher rates applied to industrial consumers . in\\r\\nvarious countries , tariff increases and the phasing out of subsidies have\\r\\nbeen scheduled , but such decisions remain politically sensitive to enforce .\\r\\nthis has recently been emphasized by high gas prices owing to the linkage of\\r\\nimported gas to oil prices . all candidate countries have set legal frameworks\\r\\nthat include the phasing out of cross - subsidies as part of sector reform , but\\r\\nthe actual implementation will remain politically difficult . as table 1\\r\\nindicates , price rebalancing is already under way in most countries expected\\r\\nto enter the european union by mid - decade , but the legal framework itself\\r\\ncannot guarantee the pace of reform . the same goes for candidate countries\\r\\nthat have only recently introduced eu - complying energy laws and whose entry\\r\\nto the european union is likely to happen in a longer time frame .\\r\\n* unbundling . most countries understand that the unbundling of transmission\\r\\ncompanies from their supply businesses is the second critical element of\\r\\nliberalization . to date , unbundling the accounts of these two businesses is\\r\\nall that has been adopted by the member states or in the candidate countries .\\r\\nin the future , the commission is likely to press all eu countries for legal\\r\\nseparation ( \\x01 & structural unbundling \\x01 8 ) of the businesses , and candidate\\r\\ncountries will have to pursue their reform of the gas sector accordingly .\\r\\ntable 1 gives an overview of the state of play in candidate countries . as the\\r\\ntable shows , the countries belonging to the second group have only very\\r\\nrecently undertaken the reform of the gas sector in accordance with the\\r\\ndirective , whereas change had been introduced earlier in the countries\\r\\nscheduled for the first wave .\\r\\n* * end * *\\r\\nfollow above url for full report .\\r\\ncome shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , \" shooting the rapids :\\r\\nstrategies and risks for the energy future \" in houston , february 12 -

\\x01 8\\r\\nsure , linux on the desktop has become more accessible than ever , with\\r\\ncolorful , shrink - wrapped boxes of caldera , red hat and corel linux now\\r\\navailable at places like compusa . however , analysts have said that\\r\\nlinux \\x01 , s growth in the enterprise will be limited to the macro and micro\\r\\nareas of network servers and embedded operating systems .\\r\\naccording to idc , linux currently runs on only 4 % of u . s . desktops . the\\r\\nhold microsoft windows has on the desktop market will remain strong ,\\r\\nanalysts say , despite such factors as microsoft \\x01 , s antitrust problems\\r\\nand the surging popularity of linux .\\r\\neven some linux executives are skeptical of their product \\x01 , s desktop\\r\\nfuture . recently , suse ceo roland dyroff downplayed linux \\x01 , s future on\\r\\ndesktops . dyroff said , \\x01 & given the lack of applications available , we\\r\\nreally can ' t claim it as being competitive on the desktop yet . \\x01 8\\r\\na recent survey by survey . com gives more hope for linux desktops .\\r\\naccording to the survey of 1 , 640 enterprise network managers , open\\r\\nsource operating systems are used on 10 % of desktops , with the number\\r\\njumping to a surprising 23 % of enterprise desktops by 2002 .\\r\\ndespite the mix of numbers being thrown around , two important factors\\r\\nthat will determine the success of linux as an enterprise client\\r\\ndesktop are : a standardized , easy - to - use graphical user interface ( gui )\\r\\nand available applications .\\r\\none company that is working to make linux more user friendly is palo\\r\\nalto - based eazel , which is designing a next - generation file management\\r\\nsystem and user interface to run on top of the linux kernel . according\\r\\nto eazel \\x01 , s web site , the company \\x01 , s goal is to bring linux to the masses\\r\\nand \\x01 & do it in a way that appeals to today ' s linux users and to mere\\r\\nmortals . \\x01 8\\r\\nthe company was founded by a group of former apple executives , and is\\r\\nallied with the gnome project , which has been doing extensive linux\\r\\ndesktop environment development for several years . eazel is due to have\\r\\na product out by the middle of this year . with an intuitive , icon - based\\r\\nfile management environment , eazel is hoping its user interface will be\\r\\nan improvement over the two current linux guis , gnome and kde , and will\\r\\nhelp standardized the look and feel of linux for \\x01 & regular \\x01 8 users . for\\r\\nenterprise mangers who have already embraced linux on the server side ,\\r\\nthis development will be worth keeping an eye on .\\r\\non the applications side , several office productivity suites have been\\r\\navailable for some time , such as sun \\x01 , s staroffice suite and koffice for\\r\\nthe kde desktop . corel has also ported its office products , such as\\r\\nwordperfect , over to linux to complement its own distribution of the\\r\\noperating system . while there have been recent rumors ( started by linux\\r\\ncare vice president arthur tyde ) that microsoft is working on a port of\\r\\nms office to linux , microsoft officials deny this .\\r\\nwhile linux may never supplant windows as the industry - standard desktop ,\\r\\nthere should be plenty of opportunity for linux pcs in enterprise nets\\r\\nin the future .\\r\\nto contact phil hochmuth :\\r\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\r\\nphil hochmuth is a writer and researcher for network world , and a former\\r\\nsystems integrator . you can reach him at mailto : phochmut @ nww . com .\\r\\nfor related links - - click here for network world ' s home page :\\r\\nhttp : / / www . nwfusion . com\\r\\nstaroffice software from sun\\r\\nhttp : / / www . sun . com / staroffice\\r\\ncorel linux os\\r\\nhttp : / / www . corel . com / freedom / freedom . htm\\r\\neazel\\r\\nhttp : / / www . eazel . com\\r\\ngnome - - the gnu network object model environment\\r\\nhttp : / / www . gnome . org\\r\\nkoffice - - the integrated office suite for kde , the k desktop\\r\\nenvironment\\r\\nhttp : / / koffice . kde . org /\\r\\ncobalt networks , inc .\\r\\nhttp : / / www . cobaltnetworks . com\\r\\nprogressive systems\\r\\nhttp : / / www . progressive - systems . com\\r\\npicazo\\r\\nhttp : / / www . picazo . com\\r\\nother linux - related articles from network world :\\r\\nactive directory upgrade requires strong game plan , network world ,\\r\\n03 / 13 / 00\\r\\nsubscription services\\r\\nto subscribe or unsubscribe to any network world e - mail newsletters ,\\r\\ngo to :\\r\\nto change your email address , go to :\\r\\nsubscription questions ?

mail . my phone number is ( 617 ) 492 - 9551 . i don \\' t\\r\\nhave a currect resume , but if i did it would say that i graduated from\\r\\nprinceton university in 1996 ( mathematics ) , and came straight to mit for a\\r\\nphd in operations management at the sloan schoolof management . in my first\\r\\nthree years i took all the required coursework in mathematics ,\\r\\noptimization , stochastic processes , etc . , as well as a number of courses in\\r\\npsychology ( at mit and harvard ) . i am working with prof . gabriel bitran ,\\r\\nand i am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations . in\\r\\nparticular , i am interested in the interaction between customers and\\r\\ncompanies ( hence the interest in psychology ) . the ( tentative ) title of my\\r\\nphd thesis is \" pricing substitute products on the internet \" , and i am\\r\\nsending you the summary which i sent to tom gros a few weeks ago that will\\r\\ngive you an idea of what this research is about .\\r\\nthanks again , and i \\' m looking forward to meeting you and your research\\r\\ngroup next week .\\r\\npaulo\\r\\npricing substitute products on the internet\\r\\nobjective :\\r\\nto develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold\\r\\non\\r\\nthe internet .\\r\\nmotivation :\\r\\nthis reseach is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and optimization\\r\\nmodels are not appropriate for internet - related businesses . the technological\\r\\ninnovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of\\r\\ninformation\\r\\nwhich inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices .\\r\\nfurthermore ,\\r\\ncompanies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can\\r\\nhave access to .\\r\\nthe problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue\\r\\nfaced\\r\\nby internet companies . consumers usually search for generic products ( e . g ,\\r\\nvcrs\\r\\nor computers ) without knowing exactly what they will buy . companies can show\\r\\ndifferent products and different prices to each consumer . this type of\\r\\nflexibility\\r\\nwas not available until the internet came about .\\r\\nthe problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet . the\\r\\nmethodology developed by this research should be transferrable to a number of\\r\\nother settings , such as pricing services . services are unique , and there are\\r\\nmany cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a\\r\\ngiven company . our model will help companies decide which services to offer\\r\\nto which customers and how much to charge for these services .\\r\\nresearch strategy :\\r\\nour research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components\\r\\nwhich can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies . these\\r\\ncomponents are choice models and optimization models .\\r\\nchoice models :\\r\\nchoice models describe how customers make choices . the management literature\\r\\ndraws on two main sources for these models : psychology and economics . the\\r\\ncommon approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic\\r\\nelimination methods . these methods consist of the elimination of options\\r\\nbased on the sequential eliminations of features until only one choice\\r\\nremains .\\r\\nthese methods tend to be very context - specific and do not lend themselves very\\r\\neasily to mathematical analysis . economists focus on utility - maximing models\\r\\nthat are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological\\r\\nmodels .\\r\\nthe most common economic model of choice is the logit model . the problem with\\r\\nthese types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how\\r\\nconsumer make choices on the internet . the first step in our research will\\r\\nbe\\r\\nto develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between\\r\\ncustomers\\r\\nand companies on the internet .\\r\\noptimization :\\r\\ntraditionally , the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a\\r\\ncertain planning horizon . on the internet , the problem of maximizing revenue\\r\\nstill exists , but there is also a need to learn about customers . short term\\r\\nprofit is based on sales , but long term profit is based on how well you know\\r\\nyour customers and are able to retain them . the optimization problem must\\r\\ntherefore include a short term component ( sales ) and a long term component\\r\\n( learning ) .',\n",

based insurance products developed in recent years have\\r\\nbeen somewhat slow to get off the ground .\\r\\nalthough several exchanges have offered derivative contracts since\\r\\nthe mid - 1990 s to cover insurance risks , none so far has posted a\\r\\nsignificant volume of trades .\\r\\nfew insurers , reinsurers or policyholders have been drawn away\\r\\nfrom the traditional insurance markets , where capacity remains\\r\\nabundant and relatively cheap .\\r\\nas long as those traditional markets manage to weather major\\r\\nnatural catastrophes , the allure of the exchange - based products will\\r\\nremain limited , observers say .\\r\\nalso stifling the growth of the exchange - based contracts is the\\r\\nlimited number of contracts available , one expert noted . dealers , he\\r\\nsaid , are unable to secure a suitable hedge by laying off one\\r\\ncontract against another .\\r\\nalthough the various exchanges have had a good opportunity to\\r\\nestablish a widely used set of new risk financing products , that has\\r\\nnot been achieved , said morton lane , senior managing director ,\\r\\ncapital markets division at gerling global financial products in\\r\\nnew york .\\r\\nthe main problem with the existing exchanges is that they do not\\r\\noffer a sufficiently diverse array of products , he said . the only way\\r\\nto control the risks in the catastrophe options is to have a diversified\\r\\nportfolio of other contracts , and none of the exchanges currently\\r\\noffers a sufficiently broad range of options to provide for that\\r\\nhedge , he said .\\r\\nflorida windstorm options , for example , cannot be bought and then\\r\\nhedged in the same way that international business machines corp .\\r\\nstock options contracts can be hedged with ibm stock , mr . lane\\r\\nexplained .\\r\\nthe exchanges might be more attractive to investors if , in addition to\\r\\nnatural catastrophe options , they included options on other risks , he\\r\\nsaid . those might include , for example , satellite , aviation and crop\\r\\nindexes , mr . lane said . \" for the insurance buyer , such exchange\\r\\ninstruments would not represent the perfect risk transfer vehicle , but\\r\\nas long as they are quantifiable and indexable , they may represent a\\r\\ngood surrogate , \" he said .\\r\\nthe exchanges could also be used to create a derivatives market for\\r\\nover - the - counter securitized deals , if there are regular issuers of\\r\\ncatastrophe bonds , mr . lane said .\\r\\nthe soft insurance market has also hindered the growth of\\r\\nexchange - based insurance products , said sean f . mooney , senior\\r\\nvp and chief economist at guy carpenter & co . , the reinsurance\\r\\nbrokerage unit of marsh inc . in new york .\\r\\n\" the traditional market has been so competitive that people are not\\r\\nlooking for other ways of doing business , \" he said .\\r\\nat least in concept , the exchange - based deals are generally similar\\r\\nto the mortgage - backed securities that have been a huge success\\r\\nsince they were introduced in the 1970 s . \" there is a belief that\\r\\nalternative means of transferring risks will grow , but it is difficult to\\r\\npredict when , \" mr . mooney said .\\r\\ncurrently , the trading that is taking place typically involves\\r\\nestablished insurers and reinsurers , so the exchanges have not\\r\\nbrought substantial new capacity to the marketplace , he said .\\r\\nguy carpenter provided the index for the bermuda commodities\\r\\nexchange reinsurance products . the bce did not take off ,\\r\\nhowever , and was suspended last year after two years of little\\r\\nactivity .\\r\\nthe oldest of the insurance - related , exchange - based derivative\\r\\nproducts are the catastrophe options traded on the chicago board\\r\\nof trade , which began trading the options in 1996 .\\r\\ninitially , there was substantial interest in the options , but the soft\\r\\ntraditional market has hampered use of the contracts to hedge\\r\\ncatastrophe exposures , said carlton purty , an independent broker\\r\\nat the cbot who trades in options .\\r\\nno catastrophe option trades have been completed at the cbot\\r\\nso far this year , he said . last year , there was increased interest in\\r\\nthe contracts because of hurricane floyd , but few contracts were\\r\\ntraded , mr . purty said .\\r\\n\" i think a major , major catastrophe will have to happen before they\\r\\nreally take off , \" he said .\\r\\nthe contracts offer real protection , and options dealers are keen to\\r\\ntrade in a new niche , but the conventional insurance and reinsurance\\r\\nmarkets are so soft that few companies are turning to alternative\\r\\ncoverage options , mr . purty said .\\r\\nthe catastrophe risk exchange , located in princeton , n . j . , has\\r\\nradically changed its structure since it was originally announced in\\r\\nmid - 1996 , and it is well positioned to expand , said frank sweeney ,\\r\\nchief operating officer .\\r\\ncatex initially planned to be a computer - based facility for\\r\\nreinsurers that would enable them to exchange catastrophe risks\\r\\nand to build balanced portfolios .\\r\\nbut by the time the exchange was operational in november 1996 , it\\r\\nwas clear that most reinsurers and insurers interested in catex\\r\\nwanted only to buy and sell conventional reinsurance , mr . sweeney\\r\\nsaid .\\r\\nalthough there was some interest in risk swapping , only a handful of\\r\\nrisks were posted on the system , and none was traded , mr .\\r\\nsweeney said .\\r\\nconsequently , catex has become chiefly a \" cash for cover \"\\r\\nexchange , he said , noting that the risks reinsured on the exchange\\r\\ninclude property catastrophe coverage , aviation and liability\\r\\ncoverages . catex also trades industry loss warranties , where\\r\\ncoverage is triggered by an actual loss combined with an industry\\r\\nloss over an agreed threshold .\\r\\nother adjustments to the exchange included making it accessible\\r\\nthrough the internet in november 1998 . and late last year , catex\\r\\noffered users the ability to set up smaller networks , allowing them\\r\\nform groups whose members do business only with one another .\\r\\nsince its inception , catex has completed about 450 trades ,\\r\\ntotaling $ 400 million in premium and more than $ 3 billion in limits ,\\r\\nhe said . catex \\' s roughly 160 subscribers include reinsurers ,\\r\\ninsurers and corporate entities that purchase coverage through their\\r\\ncaptives , mr . sweeney said .\\r\\n\" we obviously have a long way to go , but we are pretty satisfied\\r\\nwith what we have achieved so far , \" mr . sweeney said .\\r\\nthe exchange sees increased activity after major losses , as cedents\\r\\nseek to buy replacement coverage to offset depletions in their\\r\\nexisting cover , he said . for example , mr . sweeney said , there was\\r\\na flurry of activity after the european windstorms in december last\\r\\nyear .\\r\\nlast september , the chicago mercantile exchange entered the field\\r\\nof insurance - related derivatives when it began offering weather\\r\\nderivatives .\\r\\nthus far , 420 futures contracts have been traded , said larry\\r\\ngrannan , senior director in product marketing at the cme .\\r\\nsuch contracts are designed to allow businesses to hedge against\\r\\nweather - related losses . for example , a utility may sell less power in\\r\\na mild winter , and it would be able to use the futures to hedge a\\r\\nresultant fall in revenues .\\r\\nthe exchange first offered heat - based indexes for atlanta , chicago ,\\r\\ncincinnati and new york . in january , it added philadelphia , dallas ,\\r\\ndes moines , las vegas , tucson and portland , and it began offering\\r\\ncontracts based on cold weather .\\r\\ncurrently , most of the trades are between securities dealers\\r\\nthemselves , but , eventually , the contracts will likely be used more\\r\\nextensively by utilities and insurers , mr . grannan said .\\r\\nin addition , the futures contracts could be used as hedges for\\r\\nover - the - counter securitized deals , he said .\\r\\ncopyright , 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .',\n",

       "  b'Subject: california update 5 / 4 / 01\\r\\nif you have any questions , please contact kristin walsh at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510 .\\r\\nbridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8 th deadline due to lack of support\\r\\nsources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance / bridge loan by the may 8 th deadline . any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart . according to sources , both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis . the democratic caucus is reportedly \" unwilling to fight \" for davis . many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that , once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund , davis would \" double dip \" into the fund . clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor . however , it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated , a bond issuance will take place . additionally , some generator sources have reported that some of the long - term power contracts ( as opposed to those still in development ) require that the bond issuance happen by july 1 , 2001 . if not , the state may be in breach of contract . sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8 th , having a bond issuance by july lst will be very difficult .\\r\\nthe republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would \" eat \" the $ 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund , thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $ 8 billion . however , the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession . sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor \\' s plan for handling the crisis , including the details and terms of all long - term contracts he has negotiated , before they will support the bond issuance to go forward .\\r\\ncurrently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ; ab 8 x and ab 31 x . ab 8 x authorizes the dwr to sell up to $ 10 billion in bonds . this bill passed the senate in march , but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support . ab 31 x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts . however , sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen , currently in ab 8 x . senator bowen \\' s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments ( which , if passed , would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy ) .\\r\\naccording to sources close to the republicans in the legislature , republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund . for instance , tony strickland has stated that only 1 / 2 of the bonds ( or approximately $ 5 billion ) should be issued . other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds . the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday . additionally , lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan .\\r\\nkey points of the bridge financing\\r\\ninitial loan amount : $ 4 . 125 b\\r\\nlenders : jp morgan $ 2 . 5 b\\r\\nlehman brothers $ 1 . 0 b\\r\\nbear stearns $ 625 m\\r\\ntax exempt portion : of the $ 4 . 125 b ;

       "  b'Subject: california update 1 / 22 / 01\\r\\nexecutive summary\\r\\ndiscussions continue today over bill ablx , focus will be on price and term .\\r\\nnew legislation introduced today whereby the state will try to save the\\r\\nutilities from bankruptcy by taking ownership of utilities \\' hydro assets in\\r\\nexchange for rate increases .\\r\\nwednesday , state receives bids from auction , rate ranges are expected to be\\r\\nbetween 5 . 5 and 8 . 0 cents per kilowatt hour .\\r\\nmid week , audit findings will be released ; audit expected to show pg & e \\' s\\r\\nutility subsidiary handed over $ 5 b to the holding company . the holding\\r\\ncompany used $ 4 . 4 b to pay shareholder dividends and buyback stock .\\r\\nstate commissioned study to see who would benefit more in a possible\\r\\nbankruptcy scenario . bankruptcy still very possible for both\\r\\ncompanies .\\r\\ndavis concerned about possible ballot issues and how those may effect futue\\r\\nsolutions or \" bail out \" .\\r\\nlegislation\\r\\nthere will be continued discussion regarding bill ablx in the senate today .\\r\\nthe discussion will focus on the rate cap of 5 . 5 cents per kilowatt hour as\\r\\nwell as the term . assemblyman keeley , the author , indicated that he believed\\r\\n5 . 5 cents was \" a fantasy \" and impossible to obtain .\\r\\ntoday , assembly speaker bob hertzberg , d - sherman oaks and assemblyman fred\\r\\nkeeley , d - boulder creek will introduce legislation whereby the state\\r\\nwould temporary or permanently take both pg & e and edision \\' s hydroelectric\\r\\nfacilities or transmission lines ( or both ) in exchange for keeping the\\r\\nutilities out of\\r\\nbankruptcy . the state would allow pg & e and edison to impose rate increases ,\\r\\nhowever , the rates would not rise beyond the hikes approved earlier this\\r\\nmonth by the cpuc as an emergency surcharge . the money collected from\\r\\nconsumers would go toward paying off their current debt and the state\\r\\nwould then enter into long - term contracts with power generators . under the\\r\\nbill , the state of california would control 10 % of all california \\' s\\r\\nelectricity . as you\\r\\ncan imagine , this legislation has not received unanimous praise . according\\r\\nto recent corporate filings , pg & e \\' s hydroelectric plants alone would be\\r\\nvalued\\r\\nbetween $ 3 and $ 5 billion . this amount just happens to be what davis\\r\\nestimates to be the final amount of money the state will have to guarantee\\r\\nonce\\r\\nthe audit of the utility companies is released and the political pressure is\\r\\nescalated on the parent companies to absorb some of the $ 12 billion in debt .\\r\\ndavis\\r\\nis telling people that he thinks the audit will show the state should help\\r\\nwith about $ 4 billion in debt , while the utilities , of course , say the full\\r\\n$ 12 billion should\\r\\nbe covered .\\r\\non wednesday , state officials will see the results of sealed bids from energy\\r\\nsuppliers for long term contracts and see how close to reality their\\r\\neffort to keep utility rates unchanged for consumers will come . davis\\r\\ninsists there are already several bids for his 5 . 5 cents per kilowatt hour\\r\\nceiling , though few\\r\\nagree with his opinion . a handful of smaller , independent electricity\\r\\nproviders with about a 30 % share of california power market , indicated sunday\\r\\nnight they would come down to \" less than eight cents \" or less than half of\\r\\nwhat they currently charge , in return for the stability of long term\\r\\ncontracts . because\\r\\nconsumers pay about 6 . 5 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity under current\\r\\npuc rules , any hope california has to \" work off \" the back debts for these\\r\\nutilities lies\\r\\nin hitting something very close to davis \\' price cap , without falling back on\\r\\nhigher prices for consumers . the level of bids will be particularly\\r\\nimportant since bond\\r\\nrating agencies moved to put the state of california on a credit watch on\\r\\nfriday , worried that there was no obvious long - term repayment plan for the\\r\\nbillions of\\r\\ndollars they are on the hook for spending to keep the lights on in the state .\\r\\nutility \\' s audit\\r\\nby the middle of this week , california auditors will release their findings\\r\\nabout how much money pg & e and socal edison actually owe to institutions\\r\\noutside their own holding company structure . this will define the limits of\\r\\nwhat the state will guarantee , if they guarantee any of the debt . the truly\\r\\nexplosive\\r\\npart of the audit may be its findings that the two companies used billions of\\r\\ndollars from consumers to buy back their own stock in recent years . a\\r\\nsource with\\r\\nknowledge of the audits said the audit is expected to show that in the last\\r\\nthree years , pg & e \\' s utility subsidiary handed over about $ 5 billion to the\\r\\nholding\\r\\ncompany . of that total , the holding company used $ 4 . 4 billion to pay\\r\\nshareholder dividends and buyback shares of its stock .\\r\\nanother finding from the audit shows that state helped caused the current\\r\\npower crisis when regulators , at the time of deregulation ( under the\\r\\ndirection of\\r\\nformer r - gov . pete wilson ) , forced the two utilities to sell at least half of\\r\\ntheir power - generating plants . auditors are expected to say that if the\\r\\nutilities\\r\\nstill owned all these plants , electricity would cost only 7 cents a kilowatt\\r\\nhour , compared with over 30 cents an hour on average in december and january .\\r\\nbankruptcy\\r\\nthe threat of bankruptcy is still very real for both utilities . senior\\r\\nadvisors said that these utilities were on the path often followed by utility\\r\\ncompanies that\\r\\nended in bankruptcy . as all the parties involved hunker down for another\\r\\nintensely political week , they all remain determined to avoid bankruptcy , but\\r\\nto push\\r\\nthis as close to the brink as possible in the hopes of squeezing out an\\r\\nadvantage . under such conditions , the risks of one or more of the players\\r\\nfumbling and\\r\\ntriggering the great unknowable outcome of bankruptcy , is still quite high .\\r\\ncalifornia \\' s political leaders order a series of independent analyses to\\r\\ndetermine who would suffer most in a case of bankruptcy , the state or the two\\r\\nutilities .\\r\\nthe short answer was that no one has any idea . below are the findings of the\\r\\nreport and some of the possible scenarios that would face a bankruptcy judge :\\r\\n1 ) would the companies be eligible for chapter 11 style temporary bankruptcy ?\\r\\nsome of the advisors thought that pg & e and edison \\' s finances were so\\r\\nbad that chapter 11 style temporary bankruptcy may not even be an option .\\r\\nadvisors said that a bankruptcy judge might take a good look at the corporate\\r\\ndebt load and decide that reorganization would do no good and order the\\r\\ncompanies into full liquidation . this would most certainly be guaranteed\\r\\nchaos .\\r\\n2 ) could the bankruptcy court actually force the puc to raise the price of\\r\\nelectricity to consumers ? the legal basis for passing on rate increases to\\r\\nconsumers is a lot less solid than originally thought , particularly if there\\r\\nis widespread public outrage directed at the electricity companies . and\\r\\nthere is still the\\r\\nquestion of the unilateral power of a bankruptcy judge .\\r\\n3 ) if the bankruptcy judge takes his job of protecting corporate assets\\r\\nseriously and finds that pg & e and edison cannot afford to buy electricity ,\\r\\nhe could order them to stop buying it and thus lead to massive power outages .\\r\\n4 ) if the utilities go into bankruptcy , the first creditors in line would be\\r\\nthe lenders and bondholders with collateral pledges . the state could become\\r\\nalmost the last creditor in line as it is just another electricity supplier\\r\\n( one of the reasons why suppliers won \\' t sell electricity on credit to these\\r\\ncompanies now ) .\\r\\n5 ) if the two companies went bankrupt , it would be the largest bankruptcies\\r\\nin history , straining just about everyone involved in the process .\\r\\n6 ) the corporate approval allowing the parent company to segregate assets\\r\\nfrom the utility by the ferc for pg & e and already in place for edison\\r\\nmay be far less effective than the utilities or the ratings agencies\\r\\ncurrently think . this is particularly true if this week \\' s audit shows the two\\r\\ncorporations transferring\\r\\nbillions of dollars in the last few years into stock buybacks and shareholder\\r\\ndividend payments .\\r\\ndavis\\r\\nopinion polls show that governor gray davis is getting high marks for his\\r\\njob , and the utilities are increasingly viewed as the culprits . one of davis\\r\\nconcern \\' s is , according to a senior official in the governor \\' s office , that a\\r\\ndeal is carved out that triggers a popular ballot initiative which is so\\r\\nanti - utility and\\r\\nanti - business that it cripples future growth in the state . according to a\\r\\nsenior official , \" no one thought howard jarvis and his property tax\\r\\ninitiative would\\r\\nsucceed in destroying our education system , but he did , with one just ballot\\r\\nline and a lot of popular revulsion . the threat of direct , popular action\\r\\nis at least as large now as then . \" consumer advocate harvey rosenfield is\\r\\nalready threatening to draw up a ballot initiative at the first sign that\\r\\nindividual\\r\\nelectricity consumers are being asked to help the utility companies repay\\r\\ntheir debt through higher rate - payer bills . this official goes on to say ,\\r\\n\" the\\r\\nanger at utility companies is so high here , that almost anything rosenfield\\r\\ncould think of would pass and we couldn \\' t do anything about it . \" this threat\\r\\nhas\\r\\nbegun to complicate the one escape route on the debt front that had always\\r\\nappeared wide open to political leaders - - floating a bond issue or a\\r\\nguarantee\\r\\nfor the money owed to institutions outside the corporate holding structure ,\\r\\nand then letting the companies work that off with profits over the next\\r\\nseveral years .',\n",

( i will be glad to put\\r\\nthis additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move\\r\\nforward . )\\r\\ni felt i was able to communicate the philosophy , scope , and operation of our\\r\\napproach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you\\r\\nmight need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs . i thought you\\r\\nwere able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the same\\r\\ntime its simplicity and effectiveness . i thought you were able to see the\\r\\nbenefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a\\r\\ncomplement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use . i\\r\\nwould be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues . i\\r\\nlook forward to your response and to moving ahead together . we view you as\\r\\na very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to\\r\\nearn and secure your business .\\r\\nif you decide to license marketpoint , we can arrange to transfer and mount\\r\\nmarketpoint and the short term narg model ( which is the model we suggest you\\r\\nbegin with ) and travel to houston to deliver our 1\\r\\nday training seminar .\\r\\nour clients are usually very fluent after that 1\\r\\nday training seminar .\\r\\nthereafter , we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a\\r\\nfew weeks while you get up to speed , very fluent , and very comfortable\\r\\nbefore you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks\\r\\nlater .\\r\\nthanks again , and all the best . if there is some item from the meeting that\\r\\ni might have forgotten to send , please remind me . my notes don \\' t show\\r\\nanything , but i was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the\\r\\nmeeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted .\\r\\ndale nesbitt\\r\\npresident\\r\\nmarketpoint inc .\\r\\n27121 adonna ct .\\r\\nlos altos hills , ca 94022\\r\\n( 650 ) 218 - 3069\\r\\ndale . nesbitt @ marketpointinc . com\\r\\n- license . doc',\n",

these plant based compounds , or phytoestrogens , when absorbed , provide many beneficial effects including stimulation of collagen formation .\\r\\nit is now known that the powerful agents in the raspberry seed materials tone the tiny blood vessels under the eye and decrease the release of the brown chemical pigment . the results are a decrease the appearance of the dark circles under the eyes . these materials also help to decrease the appearance of \" age \" brown spots , while smoothing wrinkles , strengthening hair and nails , and supporting many other significant health issues !\\r\\ncellulite is simply fat that is tethered down because certain cells in our skin are stimulated by estrogens . the phytoestrogens , polyphenols , and antioxidants from both oral and topical sources of ellagic acid interfere with that tethering process resulting in a smoother skin surface .\\r\\nwe offer this patented material in both a tablet and a topical cream . taken both internally and externally , it is easy to understand how they can achieve such obvious results so quickly , working from the inside - out and from the outside - in . happy users report a healthy \\x93 glow \\x94 which they have never achieved with any other product !\\r\\nproduct testimonials\\r\\ni \\' ve been using the product for a little over a month . i took the \" 2 face challenge \\' , and i could tell a difference in only 3 days !

       "  b'Subject: your anticipated assistant is required .\\r\\ni am mr . ike ejoh . bank manager of diamond bank of nigeria , lagos branch . i have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you . on june 6 1999 a foreign oil consultant / contractor with the federal ministry of aviationmr . barry kelly made a numbered time ( fixed ) deposit for twelve calendar months , valued at us $ 25 , 000 , 000 . 00 ( twenty - five million dollars ) in my branch . upon maturity , i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply . after a month , we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his employers , the federal ministry of aviation that mr . barry kelly died from an automobile accident . on further investigation , i found out that he died without making a will , and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless . i therefore made further investigation and discovered that mr . barry kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents , including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank . this sum of us $ 25 , 000 , 000 . 00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year . no one willever come forward to claim it . according to nigerian law , at the expiration of 6 ( six ) years , the money will revert to the ownership of the nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the fund . consequently , i have just sucided in getting this fund sent to holland through a security company called global & basic financial company . , i will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits , which will put you in place as the owner of this fund in the security company . i shall employ the service of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the changes and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate & administration in your favour . there is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the bran\\r\\nch manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction . if you are interested , please replyimmediately via the private email address . upon your response , i shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction . please observe utmost confidentiality , and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country .\\r\\nawaiting your urgent reply via my email :\\r\\nthanks and regards .\\r\\nmr . ike ejoh',\n",

       "  b'Subject: enron net works\\r\\nit is becoming increasingly clear that the development of ecommerce will have\\r\\na significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad\\r\\narray of industries . through enrononline , enron has quickly become a major\\r\\ncatalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries .\\r\\nenrononline has been an enormous success since its launch . since launch , we\\r\\nhave completed 67 , 043 transactions on line , with a total dollar value of over\\r\\n$ 25 billion . enrononline is now the largest ecommerce site in the world .\\r\\nwe believe that the competitive success of enrononline is due to one very\\r\\nspecific reason . in addition to providing a web - based platform for\\r\\ntransactions , enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the\\r\\nsite . we stand ready at all times , in any market conditions , to buy and sell\\r\\nat the posted price . this converts a \\x01 & bulletin board \\x01 8 ( the more typical\\r\\necommerce concept ) into a true market . there are very few , if any ,\\r\\ncompetitors that can provide this capability .\\r\\nwe are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be\\r\\ndramatically expanded to other products and other geographies . if we are\\r\\ncorrect , this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for enron .\\r\\naccordingly , we are initiating a major new effort to capture this\\r\\nopportunity . effective today we are creating a new business , enron net\\r\\nworks , to pursue new market development opportunities in ecommerce across a\\r\\nbroad range of industries . it is likely that this business will ultimately\\r\\nbe our fifth business segment , joining transmission mike\\r\\nmcconnell , chief operating officer ; and jeff mcmahon , chief commercial\\r\\nofficer . these individuals will comprise the office of the chairman for\\r\\nenron net works and remain on the executive committee of enron corp .\\r\\nreplacing greg whalley as president and chief operating officer of enron\\r\\nnorth america is dave delainey , who will also join enron \\x01 , s executive\\r\\ncommittee .\\r\\nglobal technology will remain intact but will now be a part of enron net\\r\\nworks . it will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did as\\r\\nan enron global function . philippe bibi will remain the chief technology\\r\\nofficer for all of enron corp . and continues to be responsible for the\\r\\ndevelopment of worldwide technology standards and platforms .\\r\\nenrononline , headed by louise kitchen , will also remain intact and will now\\r\\nbe a part of enron net works . the success of enrononline enables us to\\r\\nutilize this site as a model as we explore other markets . in addition , the\\r\\nfollowing individuals are included in enron net works along with their\\r\\ncurrent ecommerce initiatives : harry arora , public financial securities ; jay\\r\\nfitzgerald , new markets identification ; bruce garner , metals ; and greg piper ,\\r\\npulp and paper .\\r\\nover the next several weeks we will complete staffing and organizational\\r\\ndesign and will provide full details on this exciting new business\\r\\nopportunity .',\n",

       "  b'Subject: update - reimbursement of individually billed items\\r\\nthe use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past few\\r\\nyears . as a result the accounts payable department has seen a rapid increase\\r\\nin the number of invoices and vendors . with the higher volume , we have\\r\\nreviewed our processes in order to continue our rapid payment cycle .\\r\\nalthough we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual\\r\\nemployees , they often mail invoices directly to accounts payable . at times\\r\\nthey fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone . in these\\r\\ncases we return the invoice to the vendor . if the employee is designated , we\\r\\ntry to track him / her down and forward the invoice . the high level of\\r\\nemployee movement among jobs and locations at enron has made this\\r\\nincreasingly challenging . either way , we end up doing something less\\r\\nproductive than paying invoices .\\r\\nto maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessary\\r\\nfor research , we request that employees who have pagers , cell phones , and\\r\\nother individually billed items such as licenses , subscriptions , etc . , pay\\r\\nfor them by personal check or charge card ( if applicable \\x01 * payment instructions\\r\\nare usually indicated on the invoice ) and request reimbursement through\\r\\nemployee expense reports .\\r\\nby submitting these charges on your expense report , you can help us reduce\\r\\nthe amount of time spent researching and forwarding invoices , the number of\\r\\nchecks generated by treasury , the number of vendors in our database , and the\\r\\nturnaround time for payment of invoices .\\r\\nincidentally , accounts payable is currently installing a corporate - wide\\r\\nweb - based expense reporting system similar to what enron international has\\r\\nused for the past year . this will make it even easier to file your expense\\r\\nreport and receive quick reimbursement .\\r\\nwe \\x01 , d like to make this effective immediately . if you have any questions or\\r\\nsuggestions , please contact the accounts payable department .',\n",

       "  b'Subject: california on the brink - - cera alert\\r\\ncera alert : december 13 , 2000\\r\\ntitle : california on the brink\\r\\ncera knowledge areas : western energy , n . american power , n . american gas\\r\\ncalifornia on the brink\\r\\nthe california stalemate\\r\\ncalifornia moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over\\r\\ncredit - worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would\\r\\navoid selling to the california market . while numerous factors have\\r\\ncontributed to the high cost of power incurred by california \\' s utilities , the\\r\\nroot cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation . the current\\r\\ncredit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address\\r\\nthe situation . the collective efforts of all market participants should be\\r\\nfocused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible .\\r\\nwestern power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this\\r\\nsummer . perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of california\\r\\nconsumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis ,\\r\\nregulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and\\r\\nsignificant rate increases . the california public utilities commission denied\\r\\nthe requests of pacific gas & electric and southern california edison to end\\r\\ntheir rate freezes , forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance\\r\\nthe costs of higher wholesale energy . this has created an unsustainable\\r\\naccumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the california market .\\r\\nthe current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the\\r\\ngalvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to\\r\\naddress the underlying structural problems in the industry . however , there is\\r\\nno guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective\\r\\nsolution for customers and the industry as a whole . wholesale and retail\\r\\nmarkets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain\\r\\nmuddled . in the necessarily political process that will follow , it is\\r\\npossible that - as has largely been the case so far - the steps taken will fail\\r\\nto move the california power market toward a more enduring solution and will\\r\\ninstead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws .\\r\\nin the six months since california \\' s supply shortfall began plaguing western\\r\\nmarkets , regulators have done little to address the underlying problem .\\r\\nrather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage - establishing a market\\r\\nenvironment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and\\r\\ndemand side responses - efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for\\r\\nthe crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers . indeed ,\\r\\nseveral actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by\\r\\ndiscouraging new power plant additions . these include price caps , repeated\\r\\nchanges to market rules , attempts to seize generator profits , and a\\r\\nchallenging siting and permitting process .\\r\\nmedicine worse than the illness\\r\\nseveral years of electricity demand growth and low prices in california were\\r\\naccompanied by very few additions to the supply base . regulators did not pay\\r\\nadequate attention to the looming supply shortfall . the void of consensus\\r\\nover the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of\\r\\nbandaid remedies that address the symptoms , but not the cause , of\\r\\ncalifornia \\' s electric market woes . *\\r\\n* challenging siting and permitting . despite state action to better\\r\\ncoordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants , power\\r\\nplant developers still face high hurdles . local community opposition alone\\r\\nhas struck down some key proposed facilities .\\r\\n* price caps discourage investment . state and federal proposals to cap prices\\r\\nlimit the attractiveness of the california wholesale power market , especially\\r\\nfor developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment\\r\\nto more stable or more attractive markets outside the state .\\r\\n* repeated rule changes . frequent rule changes in the iso markets ( including\\r\\nthe price caps ) confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new\\r\\nplant development .\\r\\n* calls for refunds . despite reports by the power exchange , the iso , and the\\r\\nferc that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the\\r\\ncalifornia markets , state officials continue to accuse power providers of\\r\\ngaming the market . calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits\\r\\nare a threat to new plant development .\\r\\n* facility inspections . recent inspections of power plants by state officials\\r\\nto verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of\\r\\ntheir generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust .\\r\\ncera \\' s recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the west\\r\\nare not guaranteed ? to make a profit . prospects of new plant profitability\\r\\nare affected by the timing and quantity of new plants , decommissioning of\\r\\nolder units , demand growth , and numerous other difficult - to - forecast factors .\\r\\ncalifornia \\' s regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of\\r\\nfinancial viability and degrade the political environment for developers\\r\\nconsidering entering the state .\\r\\ndespite efforts by the california iso to stimulate new capacity additions in\\r\\nthe state with a special , limited - term capacity payment , cera estimates that\\r\\ndemand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the west in 2001 .\\r\\nin addition , the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a\\r\\nsufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the\\r\\nearliest . therefore , three years remain before a sufficient quantity of\\r\\ncapacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk\\r\\nof an outage .\\r\\nthe road to recovery\\r\\nthere are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity\\r\\nshortfall :\\r\\n* encourage new build . supply must be part of the answer . this requires a\\r\\nseries of steps that can help facilitate new supply build . while in principal\\r\\nsome have been taken , such as new fast track approval , the success of these\\r\\nactions can only be measured by the build itself . for now , there is still not\\r\\nenough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness . ?\\r\\n* stabilize investment climate . utilities must have assurance that they will\\r\\nultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power . this provides the\\r\\ncredit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new\\r\\nbuild .\\r\\n* move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios . one of the reasons the\\r\\npressure on customers has been so intense in california has been the absence\\r\\n( and even discouragement ) of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in\\r\\nthe state - particularly for residential and small commercial customers . with\\r\\nthe market at a peak , however , now is in one sense a sub - optimal time to move\\r\\ntoward term contracting . yet these contracts provide the foundation for a\\r\\nseries of actions - including new supply build and demand side investments . if\\r\\nthey end up above market , they will at least have achieved the desired effect\\r\\nof knocking down prices , a fact which by itself should provide sufficient\\r\\njustification for recovering the cost of these commitments .\\r\\n* encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response . although\\r\\noriginally a feature of california \\' s market design , most consumers are\\r\\ninsulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates . exposing\\r\\ncustomers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a\\r\\ndemand response .\\r\\n* encourage market mechanisms that dampen the \" boom bust \" characteristic of\\r\\nthe market . whether in the form of a capacity payment , a reserve requirement ,\\r\\nor a minimum term portfolio requirement , the california power market needs to\\r\\nmove to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the\\r\\nmarket is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to\\r\\nelicit new investment . such a structure can help dampen ( but not eliminate )\\r\\nfuture price volatility .\\r\\n* avoid continuously tinkering with the market . while the market does need to\\r\\nbe restructured as described above , it also needs to be stable and reliable\\r\\nto encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long - term\\r\\ncontractual market for power in california . continually tinkering with the\\r\\nmarket structure - such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since\\r\\njuly - only serves to undermine confidence in the market . california needs to\\r\\ndo its best to develop a long - term solution and then let the market run its\\r\\ncourse .\\r\\n* allow for greater environmental flexibility . the state should explore a\\r\\nmore balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply\\r\\nshortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to\\r\\nemissions restrictions .\\r\\n* free purpa power plants to generate . relief should be granted to purpa\\r\\npower plants that are operational , but are restricted by contract from\\r\\noperating to generate only power .\\r\\n* * end * *\\r\\nthis cera alert will be available in pdf format within 24 hours .\\r\\nthis electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information\\r\\nfrom cambridge energy research associates , inc .

    "Таким образом, была построена модель класаификации писем на спам/не спам, а также проведены эксперименты о выборе лучшего способа предобработки текста и получения эмбеддингов. Из предствленного выше графика можем увидеть, что оставляет желать лучшего лишь качество модели с лемматизацией и tf-idf. Однако не стоит забывать, что метрика recall оказывалась достаточно низкой при использовании tf-idf в обоих случаях. Можем сделать вывод, что для решения задачи классификации писем не важно, как предобрабатывать текст: лемматизацией или стеммигом, однако для получения эмбеддингов лучше использовать Bag of Words. "
