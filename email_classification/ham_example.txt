Andrey!
I explain both questions once again
1. The rating for the forum as a whole is obtained from the sum of all ratings - for reviews, for answers to them.
The task with a large program was completed within three weeks. Some students showed their program in the first week, some in the second. The work on evaluating this assignment is very long, several days. Some branches have already been fully checked, some partially, some have not been checked at all. So it so happened that the branches in which you participated have not been checked yet. If you log into the forum, you will be able to see everything written there and if the review has already been rated, then it is there. So far, less than half of the posts have been evaluated. When it is said that the entire forum has been evaluated, you will be able to check whether all your statements have been evaluated (suddenly you have viewed some), then you will definitely say so.

2. It was necessary to attach what was done. I can't open a task for one person, no matter how good the reasons are. Imagine that the task is given on paper. It was collected and taken away for inspection. And then someone says to arrange a special transport for his leaflet. It's inconvenient. Here, although in electronic form, it also turns out to be inconvenient. You can send the task to my email. Text and file. The subject of the letter is the name of the task and in which topic it is in moodle/ I'll forward it to whoever checks it. There is no way to upload the file to the system.
We will try not to lose it and check it out, but I do not promise (if anything, you will send it again).
